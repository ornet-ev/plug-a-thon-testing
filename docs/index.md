- Develop the test plans and scripts that will be used in subsequent IHE Connectathon testing and product Conformity Assessment
- Develop the test tooling used for CAT & CA V&V testing
- Develop the virtual testing infrastructure needed to conduct SDC/SDPi+FHIR testing in virtual and hybrid testing events ... 24/7!
